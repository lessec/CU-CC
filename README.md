I lead my team members on a project that develops a service.

It's impossible to complete it due to time, but the goal is to make a wig as much as possible.

The team name is Parsley, and the goal is to create a Parsley diary.

As a leader, I aimed to plan a project, create a simple UX/UI, and even develop it.
